  WashingtonDC.1.t:0 "State of the Union Adress"
  WashingtonDC.1.d:0 "In President Hoover's second term the United States plunged into a deep and dark Great Depression. \n\nBecause of the horrors of the Great Depression Hoover declaired a national emergency and postponed the presidential elections for one additional year so that the economy could be sorted out before the election. Despite the precautions made the Great Depression carried on and Hoover indefinitely postponed the election until the economy could be repaired.\nMany states saw this perpetual postponement of the presidential election as a poor attempt by Hoover to remain in power as long as possible and create a de facto dictatorship. As one of many proponents against Hoover, Franklin D. Roosevelt, among others, have stirred dissent within the United States using the postponement of the elections as their leverage. As a result of the Great Depression and the political strife and dissent it has caused, many former states have \"declared\" their independence from the Union.\nHoover now stands in front of a crowd of only a few thousand people as he adresses the dire state of the Union. Hoover declares that we are on the eve of a \"second civil war!\" and that he will \"put this country back together!\"."
